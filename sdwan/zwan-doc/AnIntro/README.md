# SDWAN ZWAN

## Introduction

One of the fastest growing enterprise networking technologies, SD-WAN can simplify network management and optimize connections to Data Centers with high level of security. SD-WAN provides the bandwidth management and intelligence needed for supporting modern applications throughout the organization such as branch offices, remote offices and Data center. The CAPEX and OPEX is reduced by mixing cheap broadband connections with more expensive MPLS connections.  

For companies with multiple office locations a secure connection with reliable, fault tolerant, fast, manageable and highly efficient network infrastructure is needed. zWAN-SDWAN solution is implemented to help enterprises achieve maximum connectivity options, minimal downtime through agnostic connectivity and highly secure streamlined network architecture. This solution is intended towards businesses whose offices are spread across multiple locations and need to install a network so that all the locations can work, communicate, and share information easily, securely, instantaneously and effectively.
