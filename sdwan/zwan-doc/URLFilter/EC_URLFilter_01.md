**Overview**Â 

zWAN edge devices support URL filtering. Currently it has a list of over 3100 websites that are categorized into various web categories.

**Functionality**

Users can override category based blocklist or allowlist by induvidually allowing a URL to be either accepted or blocked respectively. The URL can be part of only 1 category to avoid the overlap of a category being allowed and another category be denied and the URL bing part of both categories. 

The URLs can be view under the URL filter section as shown below.

Searching for a custom URL can be performed by entering the text in the search window. Sorting is not supported as the list is rather large.

When a URL is accessed, the IPs related to that URL are discovered and added to a list. These IPs are then shown under the Discovered IPs sections. This can be further used in packet steering and QoS by specifying the URL in the Destination Address.

Packet Steering depends on first packet detection and routing the packet via the correct WAN interface.
